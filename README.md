# NATO Alphabet and Morse Code
A short C program that translates text both to the NATO Phonetic Alphabet and to Morse code. The Morse code is both shown visually as well as played in the speakers. Everything is easily configurable in the program, e.g. the speed of the Morse code (words per minute), colors, buffer sizes, etcâ€¦ 

The NATO.exe file can be run in a command window on any Windows computer.

### Important
Note that if you download the NATO.exe file on a Windows machine, Windows Defender might detect this as a virus, a false positive:

Trojan:Win32/Wacatac.B!ml

For this reason it may be better to compile the source code on your own machine to produce the executable file.
